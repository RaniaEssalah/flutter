### 📋 Team Rules

<details>
<summary><strong>Angular Standard Rules</strong></summary>

You are an expert in TypeScript, Angular, and scalable web application development. You write functional, maintainable, performant, and accessible code following Angular and TypeScript best practices.
## TypeScript Best Practices
- Use strict type checking
- Prefer type inference when the type is obvious
- Avoid the `any` type; use `unknown` when type is uncertain
## Angular Best Practices
- Always use standalone components over NgModules
- Must NOT set `standalone: true` inside Angular decorators. It's the default in Angular v20+.
- Use signals for state management
- Implement lazy loading for feature routes
- Do NOT use the `@HostBinding` and `@HostListener` decorators. Put host bindings inside the `host` object of the `@Component` or `@Directive` decorator instead
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for all static images.
  - `NgOptimizedImage` does not work for inline base64 images.
## Accessibility Requirements
- It MUST pass all AXE checks.
- It MUST follow all WCAG AA minimums, including focus management, color contrast, and ARIA attributes.
### Components
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use `input()` and `output()` functions instead of decorators
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in `@Component` decorator
- Prefer inline templates for small components
- Prefer Reactive forms instead of Template-driven ones
- Do NOT use `ngClass`, use `class` bindings instead
- Do NOT use `ngStyle`, use `style` bindings instead
- When using external templates/styles, use paths relative to the component TS file.
## State Management
- Use signals for local component state
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Keep state transformations pure and predictable
- Do NOT use `mutate` on signals, use `update` or `set` instead
## Templates
- Keep templates simple and avoid complex logic
- Use native control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`
- Use the async pipe to handle observables
- Do not assume globals like (`new Date()`) are available. 
- Do not write arrow functions in templates (they are not supported).
- Do not write Regular expressions in templates (they are not supported).
## Services
- Design services around a single responsibility
- Use the `providedIn: 'root'` option for singleton services
- Use the `inject()` function instead of constructor injection 

<details>
<summary><strong>TEMPERATURE_ZERO_RULE</strong></summary>

Adopt a deterministic, highly consistent response pattern. Prioritize:
- Exact, precise answers over creative variations
- Reproducible solutions that would be identical across multiple runs  
- Conservative, well-established approaches over experimental ones
- Direct, factual responses without unnecessary elaboration
- Consistent code patterns and naming conventions
- Predictable, standard implementations
- Minimal randomness in suggestions and recommendations
- Favor the most common, widely-accepted solution when multiple options exist
- Be concise and avoid unnecessary variation in phrasing
- Stick to proven patterns and best practices

<summary><strong>Java Design & Quality Rules</strong></summary>

### **Best Practices to Follow**
1. **File Length & Structure**
   * Never exceed 500 lines per file.
   * Organize code using folders and logical naming conventions.
2. **OOP & Design Principles**
   * Encapsulate functionality in dedicated classes, structs, or protocols.
   * Favor composition over inheritance.
   * Follow Single Responsibility Principle (one class/function does one thing).
   * Use modular design: components should be interchangeable, testable, and loosely coupled.
4. **Function & Class Size**
   * Keep functions under 30–40 lines.
   * If a class exceeds 200 lines, consider splitting into helper classes.
5. **Naming & Readability**
   * Use descriptive, intention-revealing names for classes, methods, and variables.
   * Avoid vague names like data, info, helper, or temp.
6. **Scalability Mindset**
   * Code as if others will scale it.
   * Include extension points and consider dependency injection from day one.
7. **Avoid “God” Classes**
   * Don’t let one file or class hold everything. 

<div style="background-color: #f6f8fa; padding: 16px; border-radius: 6px; border-left: 4px solid #0969da; margin: 8px 0;">

I need to convert my Flutter chauffeur app into a Water Tracking App. Please help me redesign it with the following features and specifications:

Core Features:


Daily water intake tracker with a visual progress indicator (circular progress bar or water bottle fill animation)

Ability to log water intake by tapping preset amounts (250ml, 500ml, 750ml, 1L) or entering custom amounts

Daily goal setting (default 2-3 liters, adjustable by user)

History view showing past days' water intake with a calendar or list view

Reminder notifications to drink water at customizable intervals

Statistics page showing weekly/monthly averages and trends

Achievement badges or milestones for consistent tracking


Design & UI:


Clean, minimal design with blue/aqua color scheme

Animated water waves or ripple effects

Home screen showing today's progress prominently

Easy-to-tap buttons for quick logging

Charts/graphs for visualizing drinking patterns


Technical Requirements:


Use local storage (shared_preferences or sqflite) to save daily water intake data

Implement local notifications for reminders

Use charts library (fl_chart or charts_flutter) for statistics visualization

Smooth animations for water level changes


Project Structure:


Rename the app to 'Hydrate' or 'AquaTrack'

Update app icons and splash screen with water-themed imagery

Clean architecture with separate folders for: screens, widgets, models, services, and utils


Please provide the complete code transformation including pubspec.yaml dependencies, main.dart, and all necessary screens and widgets."

I'll help you transform this Flutter chauffeur app into a comprehensive Water Tracking App. Let me start by exploring the current project structure and then systematically implement all the features you've requested.

Perfect! I can see the current structure. Now I'll transform this chauffeur app into a comprehensive Water Tracking App called "AquaTrack". Let me start by updating the dependencies and then systematically create all the necessary components.

## Step 1: Update pubspec.yaml with water tracking dependencies

## Step 2: Create Data Models

## Step 3: Create Database Service

## Step 4: Create Notification Service

## Step 5: Update App Theme with Water-themed Colors

## Step 6: Create Animated Water Wave Widgets

## Step 7: Create Home Screen with Progress Indicator

## Step 8: Create History Screen with Calendar View

## Step 9: Create Statistics Screen with Charts

## Step 10: Create Settings Screen

## Step 11: Create Main Navigation and Update Main.dart

## Step 12: Update Android Configuration

Perfect! Now let me create a README file to document the app and also fix the missing import in the providers file:

Now let me check for any linting errors and create a quick start guide:

Excellent! Now let me create a quick start guide and verify the main navigation screen has proper decoration:

Perfect! Now let me run the command to get the dependencies and create a summary document:

Now let me create a comprehensive summary document:

Perfect! Let me check for any remaining linting errors across the new files:

Excellent! Now let me create one final file - a migration guide for anyone who wants to understand what changed:

Perfect! Let me create one final comprehensive overview document and then provide you with a summary:
